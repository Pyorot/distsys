inputFiles (for map task)
taskQueue = [0...ntasks-1]

freeChan chan (of type type(registerChan)) registers workers currently idle

  main thread:
while taskQueue not empty:
freeChan-> [thread] -> calls go do(task, worker) for:
- task = taskQueue.pop()
- worker <- freeChan 

  go register() thread:
registerChan -> [thread] -> freeChan

  go do(task, worker) (on a new thread):
- DoTask RPC sent to worker with task 
- await response from RPC
- if success: pass worker back to freeChan
  else: taskQueue.push(task)

now.... IMPLEMENT DAT!
