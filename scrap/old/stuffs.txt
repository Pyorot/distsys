Sequential first

  each input file is one map task
  doMap called at least ocne per map task
  doReduce called at least once per reduce task

doMap:
  reads its input file
  calls map fn on its contents
  writes result (dict format) to intermediate files (nReduce of them)
  hashes each key to pick intermediate file to assign to
  (divides up output of map task)

doReduce:
  calls reduce fn on each key in its corresp. intermediate files
  produces nReduce result files
  (gathers inputs for a reduce task)

THEN merge is called to merge all nReduce result files into single output
