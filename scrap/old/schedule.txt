 > TODO SOBRE schedule()
call:
master calls it twice per job: map phase; reduce phase

purpose: hands out tasks to available workers

 outline:
gives each worker a sequence of tasks *one at a time*
returns when all tasks have completed

 find workers:
learns about available workers via registerChan arg, which yields a string for each worker containing its RPC address (registerChan registers workers independently of schedule()).

 send commands:
sends execute-task command to worker = Worker.DoTask RPC. Args in DoTaskArgs struct (common_rpc.go); File is map task input filename (not used by reduce) (mapFiles).
