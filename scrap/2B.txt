definition of log up-to-date order relation:
Raft determines which of two logs is more up-to-date by comparing the index and term of the last entries in the logs. If the logs have last entries with different terms, then the log with the later term is more up-to-date. If the logs end with the same term, then whichever log is longer is more up-to-date.
[summary]
IF last entry terms differ: later last entry term log wins
ELSE: longer log wins
(equality iff same last term and same length)
